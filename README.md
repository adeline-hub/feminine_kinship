## 🔍 About This Project

**Networks of Solidarity** is a data-driven visualization project mapping *feminine and feminist governance structures* from around the world through the lens of **kinship systems**.

This interactive app explores how **women-centered organizations, communities, and ancestral forms of governance** mirror or reinvent kinship logic — emphasizing emotional, legal, spiritual, and economic ties across continents and cultures.

Whether you're a researcher in **feminist anthropology**, a data lover, an economist, or an activist, this project is a powerful tool to **visualize global sisterhoods**, **non-patriarchal governance**, and **alternative networks of care**.
